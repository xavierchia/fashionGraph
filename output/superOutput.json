A bit more roomy. But again, stretchy, so they won‚Äôt be BIFL. There‚Äôs also their athletic cut, 541, which offers more room in the seat but still with a taper, so you can be millennial and not skip leg day. \n\nThe best recommendation for BIFL is to buy their 501s and call it a day. Straight jeans never go out of style because they‚Äôre the default. 501 is literally their first pair of jeans, and they‚Äôre still selling. You‚Äôll notice the trend now is moving away from skinny and slim and moving toward baggy. You know what always stays timeless? Straight jeans. Plus, 501s are 100% cotton. That means no stretch, so you‚Äôre far less likely to tear them up like this",

But with stretch it's far less noticeable, so you're less likely to actually adjust your trousers properly to do that motion and just push through it, which means you're far more likely to end up causing a bunch of strain in that area and cause a blowout.",

Jeans now are expected to be cheaper than they ever have been in the history of modern retail when adjusted for the buying power of the average consumer. If people demand jeans at 50 dollars you have to provide jeans at 50 dollars. 50 dollars is not a lot of money for a well made piece of clothing in 2025 and so you are getting the crap you pay for unfortunately. \n\nAll that being said wrangler cowboy cuts are. Shocking value for the dollar. Inconsistent fits, rough uncomfortable denim, antiquated cuts, but by god they hold up",

Shorts last 2-3 years max due to living in a northern climate and not wearing them as much.  The denim would need to be 10 times as thick in order to last a decade for me.  But even then, they'd wear out faster because the thicker denim would cause the thighs to rub up against each other even more so than they do with thinner denim.  The abrasion not only destroys my jeans, but wears away any body hair that tries to grow at that spot.",

It simply isn't the end all be all marker of quality you think it is. As early as the first raw denim revival in the 00s, brands will slap selvedge on a pair of pants and charge a premium exactly because of that kind of thinking.\n\n\nCase in point, the Levis in OP look kind of flat. I couldn't find the exact jeans in OP's pic online, but other M&C (not LVC, which uses custom fabrications to match vintage spec) jeans use Kaihara denim. The same mill that Uniqlo uses for their $50 jeans. In other words... a mass produced fabric. So if anything, $25 for *that* selvedge is closer to their actual value.\n\n\nAnd you're going on about mass production as though it's the antithesis of well made clothing. All the denim that made jeans famous- the Levis, Lee, and Wrangler from the 40s, 50s and 60s WERE mass produced pants. Now Levi's charges $250 for the kind of jeans they were making in 1950 and you assume it's higher quality because it's selvedge. Wrangler never stopped making the jeans they made in 1950 but they're cheap work pants because the fabric doesn't have a finished edge. Where's the logic?",

First look for the weight. Any brand that sells high quality denim these days will write on them how many oz they are. To make your search easier go for selvedge denim. There arent many mills on the world left that do these and youll most likely end up with something worth the money. Leave out uniqlo, they may mix it with elasthan and get their custom denim made for rhem by one of the bigger mills.   \n\nThat said, Lee jeans has the 101 line and its a really great denim for 150 bucks. I recently had some pockets repaired on one and thats the only damage they have. Downside is you don't want to wash them that often and any cold handwash tough because they are raw and bleed out. If youre handy you can redye them yourself with a harder to wash off colour. Other than that i can recommend naked and famous but they will also bleed out. Reactive dye isn't really common in high quality jeans nowadays but if you start going with selvage chances are youll get at least a good pair that may need some other wasing routine than your 60 buck pair. Even the uniqlo ones mentioned are still better than anything else at that price point you can get from big labels.",

The absolute lowest figure they could come up with for *just the fabric* was around 50¬¢, and that's bottom-of-the-barrel cotton. That doesn't include any of the labor needed to actually make a shirt. They calculated the cheapest t-shirt would wholesale for $1.80 or so and again that's the cheapest \"3 Myrtle Beach t-shirts for $10\" kind of quality. They figured *decent* t-shirts probably wholesale for around $2.50-$2.75, which is about what a guy I know with band merch experience said.",

All jeans have a finite life span, whether it's due to a rip, or a hole, or simply your body growing out of a pair. If you make it long enough, you may even start feeling like your jeans are going out of style. That said, Iron Heart offers free lifetime *repairs* (not replacements) of their jeans. The catch is, you pay the shipping ($30? $40?) to either the UK or Japan.\n\nI've been into raw denim for a long time, primarily Japanese denim, and I will say that Iron Heart is \"the\" brand that is going all out in terms of durability, from the density of the denim weave to the ruggedness of the construction. The concept of their first jeans was to be able to survive a spill off of a motorcycle. But if an ordinary pair of jeans cost $50, and Iron Hearts cost, well... you aren't necessarily getting 7-8 times the jean/life over that ordinary pair.",

You can go super cheap and buy some raw wranglers/rustlers that will last you forever, but there are a ton of heavier weight denim options out there if you want something that will stand the test of time.\n\nThe main thing with making jeans last is to not buy them with any elastic and /never/ put them in the dryer.  You also really don't need to wash them as often as you think.  I work at a restaurant as a server and walk between 9k and 15k steps per shift, most of that being speed walking during the rush.

There isn't an exact science to it, but going 3 months before your first wash then washing monthly afterwards seems to be the best bet.  And owning multiple pairs you cycle through will extend their life even longer.  There are plenty of folks on there with APC's and other OG selvege craze brand jeans that are on their 10th+ year of use because they cycle through other pairs of jeans.",

The mills mix and match according to the look they are going for. \nSome use ring spun only on the outer yarn (warp) to get the look but save cost, others use ring on both outer and inside (weft) yarns. This is called Ring-Ring (or double ring) denim and is a bit pricier and harder to find but totally worth it. \n\nLevi‚Äôs Vintage Collection is Ringspun on at least the outside. It‚Äôs the only way to get the same look as vintage and why it‚Äôs pricier than the open end denim in the mainline. \n\nOne thing to note is there is a ton of sizing (starch to make weaving easier) in raw denim, so you can‚Äôt really feel the ring spun until after it‚Äôs washed down a bit. So just to feel it, I would try to find a prewashed LVC to touch.\n\nIf you just want to buy a good value pair with nicer than Levi‚Äôs quality, I‚Äôd recommend TCB denim or Sugarcane Denim.

I'm going to try on my clothes before I buy them, which means virtually everything is going to be \"slave labor\". And while I will spend an hour researching SOME things, I'm not going to do that with every purchase, either. \n\nFurthermore, if you take away the \"slave labor\" jobs that they do making clothing for basically nothing, it's not like they are going to turn around and say \"Hey thanks, now I'll walk down the street to my new, $100k salary job!\". Lol, no. They'll just do another job just like that, for probably even less pay that's even more \"slave labor-y\". The problem ISN'T that they are forced to make shirts for a buck. The problem is that they don't have any better opportunities, and taking away this one isn't going to better them in any way. What you should do, if you really care, is go make some better jobs for them. But of course, that's very difficult to do. It's much easier to just sit on Reddit and criticize people and sit on your high horse. GL with that.",

        "body": "\"why are the pockets on women‚Äôs jeans still terrible?\"\n\n\"it‚Äôs something that women have been shouting from the rooftops to ask for for a while.\"\n\nBecause most women care a whole lot more about how the jeans LOOK than whether they have pockets or not, despite what they say. If women said \"we don't care how they look, we want pockets\" and then didn't buy women's \"pocketless\" jeans but bought men's jeans, you KNOW companies would IMMEDIATELY start putting in pockets. But they don't, because women don't care. At least not enough to not buy them. They try them on, they \"look cute\" and they buy them. Then the women say \"well darn I wish they had pockets\". \n\nHere's the thing, it doesn't matter what women SAY. It matters what they BUY. They can SAY they want pockets all day every day, but if the company sells more \"cute, this makes my booty look good\" jeans than clunky ones with pockets, guess what they are gonna make? Talk is cheap.\n\n\"I agree that ‚Äúthe consumer‚Äù has the say, but effectively each individual has no say. It‚Äôs like a two party system in politics. Through everyone acting rationally for themselves, we end up in a place that no one is happy with. Yes, I will use my vote for what it‚Äôs worth, but I know fuck all is gonna change until the system does.\"\n\nSounds like a good business opportunity then. Make a company that sells women's jeans with pockets. That's great! If you're right, should be easy money. If you're wrong, you'll lose money. Take the gamble yourself instead of just sitting back and criticizing others for not doing what you're not willing to do.",

Friction kills pants.\n\nPersonally, I'd hit the thrift stores and look for older versions of your favorites. A lot of clothing has declined in quality over the decades. And while Levis used to be a staple brand of quality, they're mostly just a name now. Due to fashion trends I see a lot of jean manufacturers choosing to go for soft denim, stretch denim, or otherwise weaker than the original. That old, thick denim lasts the longest. \n\nIf you must go for new stuff, go to a workwear store or a western store and pay attention to how stuff feels. Western stores have products meant for abuse and daily wear on a farm. Additionally, don't just go by brand. Why can Walmart sell Wranglers for $19.99 (or whatever) and tack stores have them at ~$80? Because they're not the same pants. They might technically be labeled as the same style, but there are multiple manufacturing divisions. Walmart gets lower quality pants made just for them at a fraction of the cost. These are sold to consumers like us who just want something fashionable at an attainable price point. Those products wear out faster than the more high quality ~$80 version. They're like intentional 'seconds'. I think maybe you're having the same problem with your Levis. ",

My job requires lots of physical activity, running around, nasty locations all over town, etc., but I still have to remain relatively presentable for the higher-ups.\n\nMy solutions:\n\nI've started wearing suspenders. Just regular, 2\", elastic X bracers from Welch. So, that inseam will get way more stress the further away it is from your hips (the fulcrum). Think of opening scissors with a rubber band wrapped around different spots on the blades. The further towards the point, the less you can open the scissors without stressing the band. Put it right up on the rivet/fulcrum, and it's far less stressed. Requires sewing some buttons and knowing where to put them, but altogether worth it. Plus, women seem to either be completely indifferent or absolutely in love with them. Never really experienced any suspender hate. \n\nAlso, go to Joann's, Fred Meyer, maybe Michael's... if nothing else, go on Amazon. Find the iron-on adhesive denim patching. Comes in a variety of colors and sizes. Get some microcord (like Paracord but only 1-2mm thick) and some sail needles. Fuckin pre patch that shit. Look up how Carhartt or Dickies does their crotch reinforcement on Google and do the same on the inside of your pants. Replicate it by cutting out the shapes, ironing them on, and securing them along the edges. So long as the thread matches, no one will ever know. I've kept my 511s running WAY after they normally would by doing this.",

And hey, they're local to me, so I'm glad to give them a plug. \n\nWill take a moment to hop on a soap box and share some articles. If you're buying cheap clothes, you're [taking advantage of people](https://labs.theguardian.com/unicef-child-labour/) and [harming the planet](https://www.racked.com/2017/3/15/14842476/fashion-climate-change-environment-pollution). \n\nThis sub would never recommend shopping at H&M or Forever 21, of course.

If I bring home $1,000 a paycheck--right around a $35k salary, taxes depending--that's $200 *a month* on clothing. Saving up for a nice pair of jeans doesn't seem all that silly. A pair of Levi's in 1900 cost $1.25, which price adjusted is little over $100 today. \n\nOf course, other costs have risen and new ones have appeared, and I'm sure many families in 1950 would have spent less on clothing if given the opportunity. But I do believe it proves a shift in priorities and values only made possible through exploitation.\n\nAnyway, a lightly worn pair of Levi's 501s from the 80s or 90s will go for $50-$100, and are worth every penny. I'm wearing some now. Feels good/looks good.\n",

I'll give my 2 cents without seeing the care tag. \n\nThe 2 horse jacron patch looks to be of the period as its printed in brown and acid wash was a thing from the late 80s to early 90s. Acid wash always makes me think of Saved by the Bell. I also notice the double felled inseam on this pair.\n\nI wore both 550s and 501s in the 90s but preferred the button fly so stuck to 501s as time went on. I am also a smaller size but I noticed that in the late 90s or early 2000s they switched from a double felled inseam to a single line inseam (which is actually vintage correct for 501s anyway) and that was when I began to notice the decline in the quality of the denim.\n\nI have an acid washed pair of USA 501s from 1991 (36x30 if anyone is interested, too big for me) and comparing them to a pair of Mexico 501s from 2008, the denim does feel a bit more substantial. However, this guy must of had a big rotation as a I remember reading someone say in the rawdenim forum that the lifespan for jeans was like 400 wears regardless of the fabric.

It doesn't look bad as it is though. A tailor might be able to bring the cuffs up an inch or so, and taper/bring in the midsection if it's a bit too large. Keep in mind it's also a cool weather jacket, so a _little bit_ of bagginess isn't going to look out of place. The jacket looks a little wide in the shoulders, but I think that suits you.

Madewell & Gap can be found on sale rather easily.\n\nAbove that are several brands I recommend that will run from $150-250 including Tellason, Taylor Stitch, 3sixteen, Imogene & Willie and PRPS.\n\nBeyond that there are tons of other brands.\n\nThere is a denim subreddit and several threads here as well - The word SELVEDGE will bring up some good threads.

Most denim simply wears out so the quality of construction isn't usually a big factor. \n\nFun fact (I used to work in denim) raw denim with good quality denim costs less to produce than cheap denim with a heavy wash. The wash is usually the most expensive part in the entire manufacturing process. Even if you're spending $5 on denim (which is wild. Usually the entire jean is 5$ finished. Fabric is usually pretty cheap 0.50-1.50$. Zippers, construction and details usually cost way more than fabric) your costs are less than a complex wash.\n\nSo long story short when you buy expensive raw denim your buying a story.

        "body": "I'm going to stop you right there and outright say it: You are wrong. Look up if elastane or spandex jeans are less durable. If they wear out faster. The answer is a resounding yes. The jean industry KNOWS THIS because they have *acknowledged it*. Find insider business on youtube and watch their video on the subject. \n\n\"The vast majority of cases.\" Two assumptions you don't realize you are making: the fit of the jeans and their use. I do not wear skin tight jeans. Ever. I don't like the reduced range of motion and I don't like the reduced circulation. A lifetime of that can't possibly be healthy. Additionally, reduced range of motion causes your movements to put more strain on the fibers. This means just walking around you are trying to rip the fabric apart. Eventually you do. More on this below.\n\nI'm going to say I doubt your account of the spandex pants being better suited for light use. I have 100% cotton walmart jeans that I have been wearing since highschool, which is more than 12 years ago. And I'd say they have seen moderate use and also laundry abuse. I used to wash my pants after every wear*, washed in hot water and high heat dry. I dont do that now, but I used to. I can't fathom how these jeans could break down *more* by using them *less*.\n\nThe account I trust is my brother's, whom worked hard labor and is plus sized. Those jean were made to fit, not move. As such he always ripped the seams between his legs moving around at work. He switched to the stretchy kind and said they lasted longer because of the give. Both have shortened lifespans, but in this case the stretch gave an advantage because it relieved the tension, preventing rips.\n\nThe other consideration is what do you do with those jeans once they wear out. Having synthetic fibers in them makes them harder to recycle, unusable in certain cases (pot holders for example) and not as useful to patch other jeans. After all, the fibers aged and started to fail. With stretchy materials that happens fairly uniformly. With cotton, its typically from fatigue only. The fibers in one area flexed so much they broke and ripped.",
